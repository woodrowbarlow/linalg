# linalgesic

a rust library to make linear algebra painless.

(not really, i just thought the name was clever.)

i'm taking a linear algebra course and the best way for me to understand the
material is to code it, so that's what i'm doing. i'm also taking the
opportunity to practice my skills with rust, which i'm only just learning.
